Retrofit 
Retrofit is a REST Client for Java and Android. It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice. In Retrofit you configure which converter is used for the data serialization. Typically for JSON you use GSon, but you can add custom converters to process XML or other protocols. Retrofit uses the OkHttp library for HTTP requests.


Retrofit will save your development time, And also you can keep your code in developer friendly. Retrofit has given almost all the API's to make server call and to receive response. internally they also use GSON to do the parsing.
